Implement and export by default a function that creates a rational number. A rational number must be represented by an object with the following methods:

- Setter `setNumer()` - sets the numerator
- Setter `setDenom()` - sets the denominator
- Getter `getNumer()` - returns the numerator
- Getter `getDenom()` - returns the denominator
- Getter `toString()` - returns a string representation of the number
- Method `add()` - adds the fraction on which it was called to the fraction passed and returns a new rational number (does not change the current one!)
